# IIITB-Hogwarts

* This is going to be fun project for our college students. Thinking of bringing Harry Potter style group division into college. This is going to be a mobile application and the platform/frameworks are subject to discussion. 

## Basic Thought

* All the students could be assigned different groups at the time of login depending upon some questions answered. Relating to the hat scene in movie.
* The app could consist of starting activity as townhall which could contain notices for all the students.
* Later it could have separate space for all the groups, where access is given through a magical spell assigned by group leader. These separate spaces are meant for issues relating particular group.
* App could contain a terminal window where spells could be casted, spells refer to some predefined codes that initiate some action.
* Can also contain a personal space where personal notes could be maintained which can later be discovered by other wizards(college mates). As in Half Blood Prince.
* **PS** These are just basic starting thoughts and can be changed according to requirements. Feel free to give suggestions.

## Contributions Best Practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

* Single commit per pull request
* Reference the issue numbers in the commit message. Follow the pattern ``` Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>```
* Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
* The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherrypicking and merging squashes.
* If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.
* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to start working on it.

## Expectations

* I expect to create a project that can be put up in front of our college students as a beautiful piece of effort, dedication and learning. And I hope we all learn about making real projects in teams and using git, an important skill. This is going to be a non-profit initiative, although expenses need to be met for which certain ways can be thought of later.
* Happy learning folks!
